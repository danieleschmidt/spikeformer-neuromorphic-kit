# ADR-001: Hardware Abstraction Layer Design

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Deciders**: Core Team  
**Technical Story**: Enable unified deployment across multiple neuromorphic hardware platforms

## Context

SpikeFormer needs to support multiple neuromorphic hardware platforms (Intel Loihi 2, SpiNNaker2, BrainScaleS, edge devices) with vastly different programming models, memory architectures, and deployment patterns. Each platform has its own SDK, compilation toolchain, and runtime environment.

## Decision

We will implement a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that provides a unified interface for neuromorphic hardware while maintaining platform-specific optimizations.

### Architecture
```python
class NeuromorphicBackend(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def compile(self, model: SpikingModel) -> CompiledModel
    
    @abstractmethod
    def deploy(self, compiled_model: CompiledModel) -> DeployedModel
    
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, deployed_model: DeployedModel, inputs) -> Results
    
    @abstractmethod
    def profile(self, execution_context) -> EnergyMetrics
```

### Platform Implementations
- **Loihi2Backend**: Leverages NxSDK for Intel Loihi 2
- **SpiNNakerBackend**: Uses sPyNNaker for SpiNNaker2 boards
- **EdgeBackend**: Generic interface for edge neuromorphic chips
- **SimulationBackend**: Software simulation for development/testing

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Unified Developer Experience**: Single API for all hardware platforms
- **Platform Independence**: Models can be deployed across different hardware
- **Easier Testing**: Simulation backend enables development without hardware
- **Extensibility**: New hardware platforms can be added with minimal changes

### Negative
- **Performance Overhead**: Abstraction layer may introduce latency
- **Complexity**: Additional layer increases system complexity
- **Feature Limitations**: Must accommodate lowest common denominator of features

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Allow backends to override generic implementations
- **Direct Access**: Provide escape hatches for platform-specific features
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking to detect overhead
- **Modular Design**: Optional components can be excluded for performance-critical deployments

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Core interface definition and simulation backend
2. **Phase 2**: Loihi2 backend implementation
3. **Phase 3**: SpiNNaker backend implementation
4. **Phase 4**: Edge backend framework
5. **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and platform-specific features

## Alternatives Considered

### Platform-Specific Libraries
**Rejected**: Would require users to learn multiple APIs and make model portability difficult.

### Single Platform Focus
**Rejected**: Limits adoption and doesn't leverage the strengths of different neuromorphic platforms.

### Runtime Platform Detection
**Rejected**: Adds complexity and makes deployment configuration unclear.
