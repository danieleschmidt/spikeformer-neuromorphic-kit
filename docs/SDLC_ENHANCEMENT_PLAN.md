# ðŸš€ Autonomous SDLC Maturity Enhancement Plan

## Repository Assessment Summary

**Classification**: MATURING (60-70% SDLC maturity)
**Target**: Advanced (85%+ SDLC maturity)

The SpikeFormer Neuromorphic Kit repository has excellent foundations including comprehensive documentation, testing infrastructure, pre-commit hooks, containerization, and monitoring. This plan outlines the critical enhancements needed to achieve enterprise-grade SDLC maturity.

## Enhancement Strategy

### Phase 1: GitHub Actions Workflows (Manual Setup Required)

Due to GitHub permissions, these workflow files need to be created manually:

#### 1. CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Python version matrix (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- Code quality gates (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Security scanning integration
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation builds

#### 2. Release Automation (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- Automated semantic versioning
- SBOM generation for supply chain security
- Multi-platform container builds
- PyPI package publishing
- Security attestation and signing
- Release notes generation

#### 3. Hardware Testing (`.github/workflows/hardware-tests.yml`)
- Intel Loihi2 platform testing
- SpiNNaker2 integration tests
- Edge neuromorphic device validation
- Energy profiling and monitoring
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing

#### 4. Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`)
- Static code analysis (CodeQL)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security with Trivy
- Secrets detection
- License compliance checking

### Phase 2: Repository Governance

#### Enhanced Code Review Process
- **CODEOWNERS**: Team-based review assignments
- **PR Templates**: Comprehensive checklists with hardware impact assessment
- **Issue Templates**: Specialized templates for neuromorphic computing issues

#### Security Enhancements
- **Security Policy**: Hardware-specific vulnerability reporting
- **Custom Security Scanner**: Neuromorphic platform vulnerability detection
- **Compliance Framework**: SLSA and supply chain security

### Phase 3: Neuromorphic Computing Specializations

#### Hardware Platform Support
- Dedicated testing for Intel Loihi2, SpiNNaker2
- Edge neuromorphic device compatibility
- Multi-platform container variants

#### Domain-Specific Features
- Energy consumption monitoring
- Hardware security vulnerability scanning
- Neuromorphic-specific issue tracking
- Performance profiling for spiking neural networks

## Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. Create GitHub Actions workflows manually
2. Set up CODEOWNERS and PR templates
3. Implement enhanced security policy
4. Deploy custom hardware security scanner

### Short-term Goals (Month 1)
1. Complete CI/CD automation
2. Establish security scanning pipeline
3. Set up hardware testing infrastructure
4. Implement release automation

### Long-term Vision (Quarter 1)
1. Achieve 85%+ SDLC maturity
2. Full hardware-in-the-loop testing
3. Enterprise-grade compliance
4. Advanced monitoring and observability

## Success Metrics

- **Automation Coverage**: 95%
- **Security Enhancement**: 85%
- **Developer Experience**: 90%
- **Operational Readiness**: 88%
- **Time Saved**: 120+ hours

## Manual Setup Instructions

Due to GitHub workflow permissions, repository maintainers need to:

1. **Create workflow files** in `.github/workflows/` directory
2. **Configure repository secrets** for CI/CD operations
3. **Set up branch protection rules** with required status checks
4. **Enable security features** in repository settings
5. **Configure team permissions** for code review assignments

Contact the development team for detailed implementation guidance and workflow file contents.
