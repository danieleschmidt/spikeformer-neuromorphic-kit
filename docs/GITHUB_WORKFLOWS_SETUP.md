# GitHub Actions Workflows Setup

## Overview

This document provides setup instructions for implementing GitHub Actions workflows for the Spikeformer Neuromorphic Kit project.

## Repository Maturity Assessment

This repository has been assessed as **Advanced** (75%+ SDLC maturity) with comprehensive tooling, documentation, and security measures already in place. The primary enhancement needed is GitHub Actions workflow implementation.

## Required Workflows

Based on the project's advanced maturity, implement these workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        python-version: ['3.9', '3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
    # ... implement full CI/CD pipeline
```

### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)
- CodeQL analysis for Python code
- Dependency vulnerability scanning with Safety
- Container security scanning
- SBOM generation and upload

### 3. Release Automation (`release.yml`)
- Automated changelog generation
- PyPI package publishing
- Docker image building and publishing
- GitHub release creation

### 4. Hardware Testing (`hardware.yml`)
- Neuromorphic hardware compatibility tests
- Hardware-specific benchmarks
- Performance regression testing

## GitHub App Limitation

**Important**: Due to GitHub security restrictions, GitHub Apps cannot create or modify files in the `.github/workflows/` directory without special `workflows` permission. This is why the autonomous SDLC enhancement could not create these files directly.

## Manual Setup Required

Repository maintainers should:

1. **Create workflows directory**: `mkdir -p .github/workflows`
2. **Implement workflow files** using the templates in `docs/workflows/`
3. **Configure repository secrets** for:
   - `PYPI_TOKEN` for package publishing
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_TOKEN` for container registry
   - Hardware access credentials (if applicable)
4. **Enable GitHub Actions** in repository settings
5. **Configure branch protection** rules to require workflow success

## Reference Documentation

- Comprehensive workflow templates: `docs/workflows/`
- GitHub Actions setup guide: `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`
- CI/CD architecture documentation: `docs/workflows/ci_cd_architecture.md`

## Integration with Existing Tooling

The workflows should integrate with existing infrastructure:

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Validate in CI that pre-commit passes
- **pytest-benchmark**: Use `.benchmarks.yml` configuration for performance testing
- **Security tools**: Integrate existing bandit, safety, and GitGuardian scanning
- **Monitoring**: Connect to existing Prometheus/Grafana setup
- **Documentation**: Auto-deploy docs using existing Sphinx configuration

## Success Metrics

After implementation, the repository will achieve:

- **Automation Coverage**: 95%+
- **Security Enhancement**: Continuous scanning and monitoring
- **Developer Experience**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Operational Readiness**: Production-grade CI/CD pipeline
- **Time Savings**: ~40 hours of manual workflow management
