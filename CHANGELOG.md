## Contribution Guidelines

This changelog is automatically generated using semantic-release based on conventional commit messages. To contribute to the changelog:

1. Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
2. Types that trigger releases:
   - `feat`: New features (minor version bump)
   - `fix`: Bug fixes (patch version bump)
   - `perf`: Performance improvements (patch version bump)
   - `refactor`: Code refactoring (patch version bump)
   - `revert`: Reverting changes (patch version bump)

3. Breaking changes:
   - Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit body (major version bump)
   - Or use `!` after type: `feat!: breaking change`

4. Types that don't trigger releases:
   - `docs`: Documentation changes
   - `style`: Code style changes
   - `test`: Test additions/changes
   - `chore`: Maintenance tasks
   - `ci`: CI/CD changes
   - `build`: Build system changes

Example commit messages:
```
feat(conversion): add support for BERT architecture conversion
fix(hardware): resolve Loihi2 memory allocation issue
perf(inference): optimize spike tensor operations
docs(api): update conversion API documentation
BREAKING CHANGE: remove deprecated threshold_mode parameter
```
