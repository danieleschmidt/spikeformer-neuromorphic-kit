## Reporting a Vulnerability

The SpikeFormer team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### Reporting Process

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via one of the following channels:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@your-org.com`
2. **Private GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Contact us for PGP key if needed for sensitive issues

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity assessment
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if known)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates on investigation progress
- **Resolution**: Timeline depends on severity and complexity

### Security Measures

#### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated code scanning with Bandit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks with Safety and Snyk
- **Secret Detection**: GitGuardian integration for credential scanning
- **Code Review**: All code changes require peer review

#### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Multi-stage Docker builds with minimal base images
- **Network Security**: Isolated container networks and minimal port exposure
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege
- **Encryption**: TLS for all external communications

#### Neuromorphic Hardware Security

- **Hardware Attestation**: Verification of hardware authenticity where supported
- **Secure Boot**: Validation of neuromorphic firmware integrity
- **Isolation**: Hardware-level isolation between model deployments
- **Encrypted Communication**: Secure channels for hardware communication

#### Data Protection

- **Model Protection**: Encrypted storage and transmission of proprietary models
- **Input Sanitization**: Validation of all model inputs
- **Privacy Preservation**: Support for differential privacy in training
- **Data Minimization**: Collection of only necessary telemetry data

### Security Best Practices for Users

#### Development Environment

```bash
# Use official Docker images
docker pull ghcr.io/your-org/spikeformer:latest

# Verify image signatures (when available)
docker trust inspect ghcr.io/your-org/spikeformer:latest

# Run with limited privileges
docker run --user 1000:1000 --read-only spikeformer:latest
```

#### Production Deployment

```bash
# Use specific version tags, not 'latest'
docker pull ghcr.io/your-org/spikeformer:v0.1.0

# Mount secrets securely
docker run -v /secure/secrets:/app/secrets:ro spikeformer:v0.1.0

# Limit container capabilities
docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE spikeformer:v0.1.0
```

#### Model Security

```python
# Validate model inputs
def validate_input(data):
    if not isinstance(data, torch.Tensor):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a tensor")
    if data.numel() > MAX_INPUT_SIZE:
        raise ValueError("Input too large")
    return data

# Use secure model loading
def load_model_securely(path, checksum):
    if not verify_checksum(path, checksum):
        raise SecurityError("Model checksum mismatch")
    return torch.load(path, map_location='cpu')
```

### Known Security Considerations

#### Neuromorphic Hardware Risks

1. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Neuromorphic hardware may be vulnerable to timing and power analysis attacks
2. **Model Extraction**: Hardware-specific optimizations might leak model information
3. **Fault Injection**: Physical access to hardware could enable fault injection attacks

#### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Differential Privacy**: Add noise to model outputs to prevent information leakage
2. **Model Obfuscation**: Use techniques to make model extraction more difficult
3. **Hardware Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for anomalous behavior
4. **Access Control**: Physical security measures for hardware deployment

### Compliance

#### Standards and Frameworks

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Following identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery functions
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system compliance
- **GDPR**: Data protection compliance for EU users
- **SOC 2**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls

#### Audit Trail

- All security-relevant events are logged
- Logs are encrypted and tamper-evident
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Incident response procedures documented and tested

### Security Updates

#### Automatic Updates

```bash
# Enable automatic security updates
pip install --upgrade spikeformer-neuromorphic-kit

# Subscribe to security notifications
curl -X POST https://api.your-org.com/security/subscribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your-email@example.com"}'
```

#### Manual Verification

```bash
# Verify package integrity
pip hash spikeformer-neuromorphic-kit

# Check for known vulnerabilities
safety check

# Scan dependencies
pip-audit
```

### Incident Response

#### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify security team

2. **Assessment**
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Containment**
   - Apply temporary fixes
   - Block attack vectors
   - Monitor for persistence

4. **Recovery**
   - Deploy permanent fixes
   - Restore normal operations
   - Validate security posture

5. **Lessons Learned**
   - Post-incident review
   - Update security measures
   - Share relevant findings with community
