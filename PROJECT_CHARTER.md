- **Hardware Abstraction Layer:** Unified interface supporting Intel Loihi 2, SpiNNaker2, and BrainScaleS
- **Energy Profiling Framework:** Real-time power monitoring and optimization tools
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Architecture guides, tutorials, and best practices
- **Validation Framework:** Benchmarking suite for accuracy and energy metrics

### Out of Scope
- **Custom Hardware Development:** Focus on existing neuromorphic platforms only
- **Real-time Operating System:** Hardware-level OS development
- **Commercial Hardware Licensing:** Only open-source and research platforms

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Energy Efficiency:** Achieve 10-15× energy reduction vs. traditional transformers
2. **Accuracy Retention:** Maintain >95% of original model accuracy post-conversion
3. **Hardware Compatibility:** Support 3+ neuromorphic hardware platforms
4. **Community Adoption:** 1000+ GitHub stars, 50+ contributors within first year

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. **Documentation Quality:** Complete API documentation and tutorials
2. **Performance Benchmarks:** Establish standard benchmarking suite
3. **Industrial Interest:** 5+ industry partnerships or evaluations
4. **Academic Impact:** 3+ peer-reviewed publications citing the toolkit
