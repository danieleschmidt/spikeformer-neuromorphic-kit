# Quantum Consciousness Research - Production Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the production deployment of the Quantum Consciousness Research platform.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.20+)
- Docker runtime
- kubectl configured
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

## Quick Start

### 1. Build and Push Docker Image

```bash
# Build production image
docker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t terragonlabs/quantum-consciousness:v1.0.0 .

# Push to registry
docker push terragonlabs/quantum-consciousness:v1.0.0
```

### 2. Deploy to Kubernetes

```bash
# Deploy all resources
kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yaml
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods -n quantum-consciousness
kubectl get services -n quantum-consciousness
kubectl get hpa -n quantum-consciousness

# Check logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/quantum-consciousness-api -n quantum-consciousness
```

## Monitoring Setup

```bash
# Apply monitoring configuration
kubectl create configmap prometheus-config --from-file=prometheus.yml -n quantum-consciousness
```

## Security

The deployment includes several security measures:

- Non-root containers running as user 1000
- Resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Security context with fsGroup
- Health checks for reliability

## Scaling

The platform supports automatic scaling via HPA based on CPU utilization.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pod not starting**: Check resource requests and limits
2. **High memory usage**: Monitor consciousness processing load
3. **Slow response times**: Scale up replicas or increase resources

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Get detailed pod information
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n quantum-consciousness

# Check events
kubectl get events -n quantum-consciousness

# Port forward for local testing
kubectl port-forward service/quantum-consciousness-service 8080:80 -n quantum-consciousness
```

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Docker image built and pushed to registry
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests applied
- [ ] Monitoring setup completed
- [ ] Load testing performed
- [ ] Security hardening verified
- [ ] Backup procedures documented
- [ ] Incident response plan ready

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Tuning
- Monitor CPU and memory usage
- Adjust resource requests/limits based on actual usage
- Scale replicas based on load patterns

### Consciousness Processing Optimization
- Monitor quantum coherence levels
- Track consciousness emergence rates
- Optimize processing batch sizes

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check application logs
2. Review Kubernetes events
3. Monitor resource utilization
4. Verify network connectivity
