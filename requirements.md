# SpikeFormer Neuromorphic Kit - Requirements

## Problem Statement
Traditional transformer models consume excessive energy, making them unsuitable for edge deployment and environmentally unsustainable at scale. This project addresses the critical need for energy-efficient transformer architectures by leveraging spiking neural networks and neuromorphic hardware.

## Success Criteria
- **Energy Efficiency**: Achieve 10-15Ã— energy reduction vs traditional transformers
- **Accuracy Retention**: Maintain >95% of original model accuracy after conversion
- **Hardware Support**: Native deployment on Intel Loihi 2, SpiNNaker2, and edge neuromorphic chips
- **Performance**: Real-time inference capabilities for edge applications
- **Developer Experience**: Seamless conversion pipeline from PyTorch models

## Scope
### In Scope
- PyTorch to SNN conversion pipeline
- Support for Vision Transformer (ViT) and BERT architectures
- Hardware backends: Intel Loihi 2, SpiNNaker2, BrainScaleS
- Energy profiling and optimization tools
- Hybrid ANN-SNN training methodologies
- Edge deployment capabilities

### Out of Scope
- Support for non-transformer architectures (initial release)
- Real-time training on neuromorphic hardware
- Custom neuromorphic chip design
- Mobile device deployment (future consideration)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Support models up to 1B parameters
- **Latency**: <100ms inference time for edge deployment
- **Memory**: Operate within 16MB memory constraints for edge devices
